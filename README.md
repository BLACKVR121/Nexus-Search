## Overview

Nexus Search simplifies the process of finding files in open directories. Instead of crafting complex search queries, just type what you need, and Nexus will construct specialized Google searches that filter out normal web pages and focus on servers with directory indexing enabled.

## Features

- **Smart File Type Filtering**: Search for specific file types (Movies, Music, Books, Software/Games)
- **Elegant Dark UI**: Clean, modern interface with smooth animations
- **Direct Download Links**: Finds raw files in open directories
- **Privacy-Focused**: No tracking, no data collection
- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on desktop and mobile devices

## How It Works

Nexus Search uses Google's advanced search operators to:
- Filter out standard web pages (`-inurl:(jsp|pl|php|html|aspx|htm|cf|shtml)`)
- Find directory listings (`intitle:index.of`)
- Exclude known file-sharing sites
- Target specific file extensions based on your selection

## Usage

1. Select a file type from the dropdown (optional)
2. Enter your search query
3. Click the search button
4. Browse results in the new Google search tab

## File Types

- **TV/Movies**: mkv, mp4, avi, mov, mpg, wmv
