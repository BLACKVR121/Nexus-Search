Nexus Search
A sleek, modern, and ultra-responsive single-page application for finding files in open directories using advanced Google search techniques. This tool provides a beautiful and intuitive interface to simplify the process of discovering direct download links for various file types.

 * Easy to Deploy: Host it for free on any static site provider like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.
üöÄ How It Works
Nexus Search doesn't host any files. Instead, it acts as a smart front-end for Google Search. When you search for a term (e.g., "The Blacklist S01"), the application constructs a highly specific search query known as a "Google Dork".
This query looks something like this:
"The Blacklist S01" +(mkv|mp4|avi) -inurl:(jsp|pl|php|html|aspx) intitle:index.of

This query tells Google to find pages that:
 * Contain your search term.
 * Have specific file extensions (like .mkv or .mp4).
 * Have "index of" in the title, which is common for open directories.
 * Exclude common web page extensions to filter out irrelevant results.
The final search is then opened in a new tab, presenting you with a list of publicly accessible directories containing your desired files.
